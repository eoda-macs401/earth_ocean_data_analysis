# ## Assignment 5 - Data Analysis Project Brainstorm
# 
# So far in this course, we have introduced you to a few new tools - these include:
#   - The Unix operating system, and navigating your file structure using the Command Line
#   - Basic Python, accessed via Jupyter Notebooks
#   - Python Functions
#     
# Soon, we'll add to this list, focusing on class goals that include:
# - utilizing packages
# - working with numpy 
# - making figures (MatPlotLib)
# - importing complex datasets to a Python project
# - even, manipulating those datasets (yes, performing data analysis)
# 
# It's going to be exciting. 
# 
# ### Think about your interests and Goals and Brainstorm your Final Project
# 
# For this assignment, I'd like to you to spend a few moments thinking about how you could apply these new skils to an actual Data Analysis project.  Yeah!! Questions you could consider when you think about this: *Do you have a topic, dataset, or problem that motivated you to want to learn more about data analysis? Are there specific computationals skills, or a diciplinary focus that you think coudl help you with your academic or career goals? Is there a data set you currently have, or that you know of that you'd like to analyze in a certain way, visualize better, or just play around with?*
# 
# To complete the assignment, you can fill out the following markdown cells (we're using a Jupyter Notebook like a form here!) with answers and ideas to the questions listed. 
# 
# Ambitious but attainable requrements for final projects for this course can be found on the [Final Projects Page](../Pages/projects).  You might want to reference that in your brainstorm session. 
# 
# 
# Question 1:  What is a problem you'd like to solve using Data Analysis skills? Think of a question, problem, or transformation that includes a modern dataset that needs to be accessed via computational tools like those we've just started to explore.  This could include exploratory work, or development of a specific kind of Reusable software element (like a calculation, transformation or modeling excercise):

# 

# Question 2: What kind of computational steps do you think this project would entail.  At the least, describe in words a few things you think you would need to do. Better - sketch out an 'outline' for a Python project that woudl accomplish these steps. You can refer to simular skills outlined above. 

# 

# Question 3: What kind of data woudl you use? Be specific here. Is there a data object type that you know you'd be working with?  Are you working with a specific data set, if so, what is the data source? What format does the data come in and how do you access it?

# 

# Submit this file as a notebook (or markdown file... either way) to Canvas *but* keep it handy has it will evolve to the Readme.md file that goes with your Final Project GitHub Repository
