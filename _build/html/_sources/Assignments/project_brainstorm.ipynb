    "\n",
    "So far in this course, we have introduced you to a few new tools - these include:\n",
    "  - The Unix operating system, and navigating your file structure using the Command Line\n",
    "  - Basic Python, accessed via Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "  - Python Functions\n",
    "    \n",
    "Soon, we'll add to this list, focusing on class goals that include:\n",
    "- utilizing packages\n",
    "- working with numpy \n",
    "- making figures (MatPlotLib)\n",
    "- importing complex datasets to a Python project\n",
    "- even, manipulating those datasets (yes, performing data analysis)\n",

    "\n",
    "For this assignment, I'd like to you to spend a few moments thinking about how you could apply these new skils to an actual Data Analysis project.  Yeah!! Questions you could consider when you think about this: *Do you have a topic, dataset, or problem that motivated you to want to learn more about data analysis? Are there specific computationals skills, or a diciplinary focus that you think coudl help you with your academic or career goals? Is there a data set you currently have, or that you know of that you'd like to analyze in a certain way, visualize better, or just play around with?*\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the assignment, you can fill out the following markdown cells (we're using a Jupyter Notebook like a form here!) with answers and ideas to the questions listed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ambitious but attainable requrements for final projects for this course can be found on the [Final Projects Page](../Pages/projects).  You might want to reference that in your brainstorm session. It describes that your project should _clearly define a hypothesis or scientific goal that you aim to investigate with your analysis_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1:  What is a problem you'd like to solve using Data Analysis skills? Think of a question, problem, or transformation that includes a modern dataset that needs to be accessed via computational tools like those we've just started to explore.  This could include exploratory work, or development of a specific kind of Reusable software element (like a calculation, transformation or modeling excercise):"
