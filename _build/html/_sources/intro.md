# Welcome to the Jupyter Book for Earth and Ocean Data Analysis

This is a collection of pages for organizing assignments and materials for the MACS497 (soon to be MACS401) course.  It borrows heavily from (and adds to) materials presented in the online text book we'll use for the course [An Introduciton to Earth and Environmental Data Science by Ryan Abernathy et al.](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html)

This site contains exerpts from the text book that you should read carefully during weekly studio sessions. It also outlines assignments you will be expected to complete and turn in for credit.  These assignments are simular to those in the book, but have been modified to be appropriate for our class. 

Check out the following pages to get started.  They will be much much more, added throughout the quarter. **Excited to be doing data analysis with you!**
