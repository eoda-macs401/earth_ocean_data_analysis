# **For the third day of class:**

#### Where we're at:

Today we'll start class by **reviewing** how to create a git repository and making a remote origin on GitHub (allowing us to share a repository via a web-interface).  If you haven't finished up [Assignment 2: Files, Git, and Github](../Assignments/files_markdown_git), make sure to do that today with help you receive in class (or let me know if you think you'll need more time)! 

We'll then move on to talking about Python basics (and do some coding) - In class we'll demo many of the new ideas about variables, objects, and methods outlined in the [Python Fundamentals](../Notebooks/python_fundamentals), that you reviewed at home last week. This material will help you to complete [Assignment 3](../Assignments/python_basics).

#### Preperation for the future:

For next week, please read about [Python Functions and Classes](../Notebooks/functions_classes).  There may be a short reading quiz at the beginning of class based on this material. 

### For today, in class: 

Today we'll be working through the intro to Python fundamentals.  To practice setting variables and talking about objects, their attributes and behaviors, etc., I'll be demoing some of the commands you read about last week (in [Python Fundamentals](../Notebooks/python_fundamentals)) in real time, via entering code into a Jupyter Notebook. We'll talk a bit about what Jupyter Notebooks are, but if you'd like more information, read more about Jupyter Notebooks from [RealPython.com](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/).  Also if you plan to follow along but haven't used a Jupyter Notebook much in the past, here's a [really handy cheatsheet](https://www.edureka.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jupyter_Notebook_CheatSheet_Edureka.pdf) you can reference for navigating the notebook. 

##### **Also note:** you can open a new Jupyter Notebook from within JupyterLab (click on the `Notebook` button when it first opens, or from `File > New`. I recommend making a new directory within your eoda thumb drive called `inclass-working`, and using notebooks saved within that directory to take notes (follow along with demos) *inclass*. 

Following class today, you will be asked to complete a homework assignment, [Assignment 3 - Python Basics](../Assignments/python_basics).  This is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.  You can download the *template* notebook from the [Assignment 3 Page](../Assignments/python_basics) directly by pressing the small icon in the upper right side of the page and selecting `.ipynb` format -  
![icon](../images/icon.png)

Then you can save it to a new directory on your eoda thumb drive for this assignment  called `python-assignments`. Complete the homework by filling out the `code` cells in the Jupyter Notebook as directed.  You can then *submit* your assignment by creating a new git repository and pushing your `python-assignments` repo, containing the `python_basics.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to GitHub (you know how to do this!).  

When you've completed the above, add a web link to the new repository (maybe something like `https://github.com/your_username/python-assignments`) to your `eoda-assignments` `Readme.md` file and push an update of that `eoda-assignments` as well. Good Luck! Do your best!

### Homework Summary:


1. Complete [Assignment 3: Python Basics](../Assignments/python_basics)
2. Before next week, read ahead about [Python Functions and Classes](../Notebooks/functions_classes)
