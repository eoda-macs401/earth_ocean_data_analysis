# **For the fifth day of class:**

#### Where we're at:

This is a time for you to dig in to understand [Python Functions and Classes](../Notebooks/functions_classes). It's also a week I'm hoping you can *catch up* on Assignments 1-4, and think ahead to the future. Last week we spent some class time going over [Basic Python](../Notebooks/python_fundamentals), and you had the opportunity to play and practice creating [python functions](../Notebooks/functions_classes) in [Assignment 4](../Assignments/python_functions). If you feel like you didn't finish this or previous assignments, this week will be your opportunity to lean on your classmates and TA to get caught up and ready to move on to new material. 


#### Preperation for the future:

For next week, in lieu of a coding assignment, you'll have a slightly heavier reading assignment.  Please read about  [Python Environments](../Pages/python_environments) and also [All about Data](../Notebooks/data). Together with your reading from last week on [Organization and Packaging of Python](../Notebooks/organization_and_packaging) you should be starting to feel like might be able to utilize these types of tools in a Python Project that does something uesful!  

[A very short assignment (Assignment 5)](../Assignments/project_brainstorm) this week will have you brainstorming a Python project that you might be interested in tackling in the future, and possibly as a part of this class.

### For today, in class: 

I'm hoping you can work independently this week in class, and collaboratively to help each other troubleshoot and understand how basic Python Fructions work (i.e. complete [Assignment 4](../Assignments/python_functions)), or anything you still need help with from the first half of the quarter. If you feel like you still need additional assistance after the Catch-Up period today - please [email me](emily.roland@wwu.edu) and give me a heads up on where you are at - I'll come prepared next Monday to try to help you tye up any loose ends.

In addition to the readings this week - complete [a short braingstorming assignment (Assignment 5)](../Assignments/project_brainstorm). This will be your homework for this week.

### Homework Summary:


1. Complete [Assignment 5 - Identify a Data-focused Project](../Assignments/project_brainstorm)
2. Before next week, read ahead about [Python Environments](../Pages/python_environments) and also [All about Data](../Notebooks/data), maybe [Final Projects Page](../Pages/projects)
