# **For the fifth day of class:**

#### Where we're at:

This is a time for you guys to dig in a bit to understand [Python Functions and Classes](../Notebooks/functions_classes). It's also a week I'm hoping you can catch up on Assignments 1-4, and think ahead to the future. Last week we spent some class time going over basic Python, and you had the opportunity to play and practice creating python functions in [Assignment 4 - Python Functions](../Assignments/python_functions). If you feel like you didn't finish this, this week will be your opportunity to lean on your classmates and TA to get a handle on basic python functions, a be ready to move on to new material. 


#### Preperation for the future:

For next week, in lieu of a coding assignment, you'll have a slightly heavier reading assignment.  Please read about  [Python Environments](../Pages/python_environments) and also [All about Data](../Notebooks/data). Together with your reading from last week on [Organization and Packaging of Python](../Notebooks/organization_and_packaging) you shoudl be starting to feel like you can think about an actual Python Project that DOES SOMETHING USEFUL!!  A very short assignment this week will have you brainstorming and sharing a Pytho project that you might be interested in tackling in the future, and possibly as a part of this class.

### For today, in class: 

I'm hoping you can work independently this week in class, and collaboratively help eachother troubleshoot and understand how basic Python Fructions work (i.e. complete [Assignment 4](../Assignments/python_functions)), or anything you still need to type up from the first half of the quarter. If you feel like even with an open class period Monday, with help from your classmates and our TA you still need additional assistance - please [email me](emily.roland@wwu.edu) and give me a heads up on where you're at - I'll come prepared next Monday to tye up any loose ends.

In addition to the readings - check out the short brainstorming assignment. THis will be your homework for this week.

### Homework Summary:


1. Complete [Assignment 5 - Identify a Data-focused Project](../Assignments/project_brainstorm)
2. Before next week, read ahead about [Python Environments](../Pages/python_environments) and also [All about Data](../Notebooks/data)
