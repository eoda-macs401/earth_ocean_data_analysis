# Welcome to the Jupyter Book for Earth and Ocean Data Analysis

This is a collection of pages for organizing reference materials, readings, tutorials and assignments for the MACS401 course Earth and Ocean Data Analysis (EODA Studio for short).  It borrows heavily from (and adds to) materials presented in the online text book we'll use for the course [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science by Ryan Abernathy et al.](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html)

This site contains excerpts from the text book that are assigned as pre-class readings that you should read carefully prior to weekly studio sessions. Due dates for pre-class readings are outlined on the course Canvas Page, however you can also follow them as they appear on this Jupyter Book table of contents throughout the quarter. The book also outlines assignments you will be expected to complete and turn in for credit. For the first half of the quarter, you will turn in assignments via Canvas, for the second half you should submit assignments via [GitHub](https://github.com/). These assignments are similar to those in [the book](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html), but have been modified to be appropriate for our class. 

Also - any of the materials in this book may be downloaded and modified within your local python environment.  Each page is either a markdown file (.md) or a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). By right-clicking on a page and downloading it, you can modify or use the code in these files for your own purposes.  For assignments, you should always start by downloading the assignment page file, and modifying it appropriately, usually within Jupyter Lab. 

Check out the following pages to get started.  There will be much much more, added throughout the quarter. **Excited to be doing data analysis with you!**
