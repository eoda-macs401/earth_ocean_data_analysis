# **For the fourth day of class:**

#### Where we're at:

Last week we just barely scrached the surface, working with [Python Fundamentals](../Notebooks/python_fundamentals).  We talked about variables in class, but will use more class time this week to discuss some of the data structures Python uses (such as Libraries and Dictionaries).  We'll also discuss some of the times you'd used conditional statements (i.e. loops, `if` statements), and how indexing works.  These were some of the things you were asked to practice in your short homework assignment last week.  If you didn't get that finished up last week, plan to complete it during or after our class this week. 

Last week you also read about [Python Functions and Classes](../Notebooks/functions_classes).  We'll start talking about these in class this week, and you'll be practicing using functions and classes this week and next in your homework assignments. 

#### Preperation for the future:

For next week, please read about [Organization and Packaging of Python Projects](../Notebooks/organization_and_packaging).  Next week - you will be assigned independent work and a mini-research project thinking about a data analysis project you might want to engage in.  The homework reading will assist you in thinking abou this, and there will be a short reading quiz next week on this material. 

### For today, in class: 

We'll start class today by going over [Assignment 3: Python Basics](../Assignments/python_basics).  If it was easy for you, plan to mentour some of yoru fellow students. If  you haven't figured it out yet, get ready to pay attention and practice these new commands and tools in class. 


We'll then move on to working through some new ideas about [Python Functions and Classes](../Notebooks/functions_and_classes). 

##### **REMINDER:**  I recommend taking notes as we go over material (follow along with demos, etc.) in a new `Notebook`, maybe saved in your `inclass-working` directory on your thumb drive. You can open a new Jupyter Notebook from within JupyterLab (click on the `Notebook` button when it first opens, or from `File > New`.

##### **REMINDER:** Here is that [really handy cheatsheet](https://www.edureka.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jupyter_Notebook_CheatSheet_Edureka.pdf) on Jupyter Notebooks from last week.  

Following class today, you will be asked to complete a homework assignment, [Assignment 4 - Python Functions](../Assignments/python_functions).  This is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.  You can download the *template* notebook from the [Assignment 4 Page](../Assignments/python_functions) directly by pressing the small icon in the upper right side of the page and selecting `.ipynb` format -  
![icon](../images/icon.png)

Then you can save it to the same directory (git repository) on your eoda thumb drive that you were working on last week `python-assignments`. Complete the homework by filling out the `code` cells in the Jupyter Notebook as directed.  You can then *submit* your assignment by pushing this new file and updating the git repository, `python-assignments` you created last week.  

As long as you already shared your `python-assignments` repository with me via your `eoda-assignments` as a link in your `Readme.md` file, you'll have submitted your assignment!

### Homework Summary:


1. Complete [Assignment 4 - Python Functions](../Assignments/python_functions)
2. Before next week, read ahead about [Organization and Packaging of Python Projects](../Notebooks/organization_and_packaging)
