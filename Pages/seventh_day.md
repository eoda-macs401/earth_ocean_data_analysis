# **For the seventh day of class:**

#### Where we're at:

We are speeding toward the end of the quarter (terrifying and exhilierating right?).  This week we'll spend some time chatting over your homework from last week on [NumPy and Matplotlib](../Assignments/numpy_matplotlib.ipynb). In particular we'll try to review  how these libraries are used to create and manipulate multidimensional arrays, and make simple plots (super important!).  

As a final goal for the quarter, we'll also move on toward practicing one of the most common ways of importing data using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).


### This week and Preperation for the future:

For the final week of new material - we'll be practicing one of the most common ways we can access (import, read - prepare to analyze) tabular data - which makes up the majority of data types we deal with in Earth Science.  This week's assigned reading will once again be necessary to complete the homework, and is focused on a library called [Pandas](../Pages/pandas_intro).  The reading assignment for the week also includes a page focused on examples of how Pandas is implemented via examples and notes on syntax, [coding examples of Pandas Fundamentals](../Notebooks/basic_pandas). 


For the final homework, complete [Assignment 7 - Pandas Fundamentals with Earthquake Data](../Assignments/basic_pandas).  Publish this to your same GitHub repostory as last week called `python-projects` (and push your changes to GitHub!) 

Note that this week you'll also need to check in with me about your final project (again... we'll keep doing this!).  Submit a modified outline of your plan for you final project by compilint the information outlined in the [Final Projects - 2 Credit Version](../Pages/final_projects_2credit). 

### Homework Summary:


1. Complete [Assignment 7 - Pandas Fundamentals with Earthquake Data](../Assignments/basic_pandas).
2. Before next week, have read about [Pandas](../Pages/pandas_intro) and [(coding examples) of Pandas Fundamentals](../Notebooks/basic_pandas).
3. Also submit your plan for your final project including the information requested... this will require making a new GitHub repo that you'll use to publish your final project.  Start this week by outlining the readme page with the informaiton outlined in the **Project Approval** section of the [Final Projects - 2 Credit Version](../Pages/final_projects_2credit).
