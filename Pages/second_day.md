# For the second day of class:

#### Where we're at:
Last week we installed JupyterLab and got started familiarizing ourselves with the Unix file system, and how to navigat through it.  This week we'll start to use some of the skills we practiced in the [Unix Tutorial](../Pages/intro_to_unix) and get introduced to GitHub. In class we'll practice making a GitHub account and *pushing* our first repository to Git.  

#### Preperation for the future:
Over the week ahead, prepare yourself to start doing some actual coding (finally!).  Read the [Python Fundamentals](../Notebooks/python_fundamentals) page as homework to start familiarizing yourself with basic Python programming - this is where things will get fun. 

###### *Note - this is the first homework reading assignment.  You may be asked to complete a short (graded!) reading quiz next week based on your pre-class reading materials.*

### For today, in class: 

*The following instructions have been modified from [the hubspot blog](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) on getting started with Git & GitHub:*

##### **The first two things you'll want to do are install git and create a free GitHub account. Then you'll proceed with learning about Git and your first assignment.**

**Step 0: Install git if you are working on your personal computer.**
Follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install git (if it's not already installed). Note that for this tutorial we will be using git on the command line only. While there are some great git GUIs (graphical user interfaces), I think it's easier to learn git using git-specific commands first and then to try out a git GUI once you're more comfortable with the command. A note: 95% of other online git resources and discussions will also be for the command-line interface. 

**Step 1: Make an account on GitHub**
Once you've done that, create a GitHub account from the [GitHub website](https://github.com/). When selecting your username, email and password, try to stick with options you'll like to use in the long-term.  A personal email may be a bit more reliable long-term than you university email, for example. Select the free account when given the option. 

**Step 2: Start playing with Git!**
Next, start with the [Intro to Git](./intro_to_git) page. Then engage with the [Assignment 2](../Assignments/files_markdown_git) material which will also allow you to submit your `First_Class_Reflection.md` Markdown file that you created last week. 

### Homework Summary:

1. Complete [Assignment 2: Files, Git, and Github](../Assignments/files_markdown_git.md)
2. Before next week, read ahead about [Python Fundamentals](../Notebooks/python_fundamentals)
