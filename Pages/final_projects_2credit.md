## Final Projects Overview - 2 Credit Version

Here is a summary of what you should consider for your final project in MACS 497 - Spring 2022.  This assignment should allow you to explore setting up a computational/coding problem on your own (for the first time!) and allow you to learn some new skills.  You can read more about what a full-scale final project coudl look like on the [Projects page (from a few weeks ago)](../Pages/projects).  

For your paired-down final projects for MAC 497 - you should identify a dataset, calculation or analysis workflow goal, and visualization that you woudl find interesting to focus on for the last few weeks of the quarter.  Specifically, your final project shoudl do the following things:

### Spring 2022 - Data Analysis Final Project Requirments:

* Read in a real dataset

Finding a dataset you're interested in workign with will be the first taks to accomplish this goal. Then you'll need to figure out a way to get it into python! This could use Pandas, Pooch or a different way of accessing data we haven't practiced yet. Reference the [Projects page 1.0](../Pages/projects) for ideas on where you can find great datasets.  You can work with your instructor or TA (and the internet!) to explore ways of accessing the daata. 

* Manipulate the dataset

Do somethign!  This could be simple statistics, organizing your data somehow, modeling it using a basic analytical model. It doesn't have to be complicated - again seek help if you need inspiration. 

* Visualize your dataset

Likely you'll want to use matplotlib functionality to make a plot, or a couple plots. You can also explore ways of making fancier maps if you are visualizing geographic data (this would involve learning a new skill). 

* Do something you haven't already practicied in a homework assignment!
I can guarentee you that you'll be teaching yourself the majority of the coding skillks you employ in the future.  This assignment ay be your first (explicit) opportunity to use python documentation, open source tools, your friends or other instructors, or google to learn a new skill!  


### Technical Requirements

Your final project must also meet the following technical requirements

*   A _single jupyter notebook_
*   Stored in a standalone public github repo
*   All data is either stored in the repo itself or downloaded / accessed from within the notebook (no manual download steps)
*   Complete explanatory text / equations included in the notebook as markdown cells
*   Notebook must execute in sequence with no errors

##  Make a plan and get your project approved - 

### Project Approval

You must have your dataset and general scope for your project improved by the instructor (i.e. four items outlined in the *Data Analysis Final Project Requirments* section above). The approval process works like this:

*   Create a new public github repo for your project
*   Add a `README.md` file which contains your plan for the four requrements avove.  This shoudl include links to the relevant datasets, and a three sentence summary of the analysis you plan to do, as well as how you will visualize your data. Also include what new skill you think you'll need to learn in the process. 
*   Submit a link to your final project repo using the original eoda_assignments readme page (from the begining of the quarter).
