# **For the seventh day of class:**

#### Where we're at:

We are speeding toward the end of the quarter (terrifying and exhilierating right?).  This week we'll spend some time in class chatting over NumPy and Matplotlib, particularly how these libraries are used to create and manimuplate multidimensional arrays, and make simple plots (super important!).  We'll also spend some itme in class sharing ideas about final projects.  


#### Preperation for the future:

For the final week of new material - we'll be practicing one of the most common ways we can access (import, read - prepare to analyze) tabular data - which makes up the vast majority of data types we deal with in Earth Science.  This week's assigned reading will once again be necessary to complete the homework, and is focused on a library called [Pandas](../Pages/pandas_intro).  There is also a page focused on examples of how Pandas is implemented via examples and notes on syntax, [coding examples of Pandas Fundamentals](../Notebooks/basic_pandas). 

### For today, in class: 



For the final homework, complete [Assignment 7 - Pandas Fundamentals with Earthquake Data](../Assignments/basic_pandas).  Publish this to your same GitHub repostory as last week called `data_analysis` (and if you haven't already, make sure I'm a collaborator!  Note that this week you'll also need to check in with me about your final project (again... we'll keep doing this!).  Submit a modified outline of your plan for you final project by compilint the information outlined in the [Final Project Description Page]. 

### Homework Summary:


1. Complete [Assignment 7 - Pandas Fundamentals with Earthquake Data](../Assignments/basic_pandas).
2. Before next week, have read about [Pandas](../Pages/pandas_intro) and [(coding examples) of Pandas Fundamentals](../Notebooks/basic_pandas).
3. Also submit your plan for your final project via the information requested...
