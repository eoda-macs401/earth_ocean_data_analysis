# **For the fourth day of class:**

#### Where we're at:

Last week we just barely scrached the surface, working with [Python Fundamentals](../Notebooks/python_fundamentals).  We talked about variables in class, but will use more class time this week to discuss some of the data structures Python uses (such as Libraries and Dictionaries).  We'll also discuss some of the times you'd used conditional statements (i.e. loops, if statements), and how indexing works.  These were some of the things you were asked to practice in your short homework assignment.  If you didn't get that finished up last week, plan to complete it after our class this week. 

Last week you also read about [Python Functions and Classes](../Notebooks/functions_classes).  We'll start talking about these in class this week, and you'll be practicing using functions and classes this week and next in your homework assignments. 

#### Preperation for the future:

For next week, please read about [Python Functions and Classes](../Notebooks/functions_classes).  There may be a short reading quiz at the beginning of class based on this material. 

### For today, in class: 

We'll start class today by going over [Assignment 3: Python Basics](../Assignments/python_basics).  If it was easy for you, plan to mentour some of yoru fellow students. If  you haven't figured it out yet, get ready to pay attention and practice these new commands and tools in class. 



Today we'll be working through the intro to Python fundamentals.  To practice setting variables and talking about objects, their attributes and behaviors, etc., I'll be demoing some of the commands you read about last week (in [Python Fundamentals](../Notebooks/python_fundamentals)) in real time, via entering code into a Jupyter Notebook. We'll talk a bit about what Jupyter Notebooks are, but if you'd like more information, read more about Jupyter Notebooks from [RealPython.com](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/).  Also if you plan to follow along but haven't used a Jupyter Notebook much in the past, here's a [really handy cheatsheet](https://www.edureka.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jupyter_Notebook_CheatSheet_Edureka.pdf) you can reference for navigating the notebook. 

##### **Also note:** you can open a new Jupyter Notebook from within JupyterLab (click on the `Notebook` button when it first opens, or from `File > New`. I recommend making a new directory within your eoda thumb drive called `inclass-working`, and using notebooks saved within that directory to take notes (follow along with demos) *inclass*. 

Following class today, you will be asked to complete a homework assignment, [Assignment 3 - Python Basics](../Assignments/python_basics).  This is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.  You can download the *template* notebook from the [Assignment 3 Page](../Assignments/python_basics) directly by pressing the small icon in the upper right side of the page and selecting `.ipynb` format -  
![icon](../images/icon.png)

Then you can save it to a new directory on your eoda thumb drive for this assignment  called `python-assignments`. Complete the homework by filling out the `code` cells in the Jupyter Notebook as directed.  You can then *submit* your assignment by creating a new git repository and pushing your `python-assignments` repo, containing the `python_basics.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to GitHub (you know how to do this!).  

When you've completed the above, add a web link to the new repository (maybe something like `https://github.com/your_username/python-assignments`) to your `eoda-assignments` `Readme.md` file and push an update of that `eoda-assignments` as well. Good Luck! Do your best!

### Homework Summary:


1. Complete [Assignment 3: Python Basics](../Assignments/python_basics)
2. Before next week, read ahead about [Python Functions and Classes](../Notebooks/functions_classes)
