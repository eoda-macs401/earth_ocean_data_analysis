# Extra Credit Assignment #

### Summary
Congratulations on making it (more than - yikes) halfway through the quarter! This extra credit an opportunity to make back some lost points and can be used as credit to replace the grade (or partial replacement) of any prior assignments (quizzes, homeworks, etc). 
### Instructions 
The goal of this assignment is to outline how you are going to or would like to solve a scientific problem with the computational tools we've discussed/used in class - *out side of class* (i.e. not for our final projects, but doing somethign you're going to need to do!). Your paragraph should have these components:
1. **Objective**: A brief discussion of the scientific problem and your specific objective in solving this problem. This could be a problem relevant to you, as in outside thesis or capstone work. It could also be a problem of interest to you, such as a marine issue (for example: measuring coral reef depletion or plotting fluctuations in tide over time). It could be somethign you think you'll need to do as a part of a future job. Make sure when thinking of an objective to: 
- Be specific about the data analysis (aka: the problem has to have data associated with it!)
- The problem can be solved with computational tools. This will require you to look into the purpose/capabilites of computational tool(s). Make sure your problem is simple and clear enough to solve.
2. **Computational tools**: An explanation of the type(s) of application(s), tools, functions, etc. you could use to solve this problem. Again, this will require you to look into the purpose/capabilites of one or several computational tools.
3. **Methods**: Evaluate how your methods relate to your overall objective. How will you use a certain tool, application, function, etc. to work towards your objective? 

### Submission
This extra credit assignment will be due by the end of the quarter before finals week. Submit your paragraph in a markdown file (.md) to your eoda_assignments Github repo, and title it: `extra_credit`. NOTE: To recieve credit, you'll also need to make Paige a collaborator on that repository. Get Paige's Github handle from her in class and share the repo with her as a collaborator in order to submit the assignment. Then you will be graded, and points can be added to the assignment/quiz portion of your grade that helps you most.
If you have any questions about the assignment or need help deciding some computational tools please talk with Emily or a TA.
