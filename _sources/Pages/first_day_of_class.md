# For the first day of class:

First of all- 

***
Welcome to MACS 497 - Earth and Ocean Data analysis!  
***

I'm excited to be working with you!  
- Your TA will be handing out *special* Earth and Ocean Data Analysis (EODA) thumb drives for you on the first day, with the first day's worth of this book included. 

**Begin by considering how you will be using JupyterLab this quarter, on what computer.**  Think carefully about this!  You'll want to stick with your choice once you commit to it. Two options are 1. a University Computer Labs computer (MH031) and 2. Your personal computer - they both have adantages and disadvantages.

##### Advantages & Disadvantages of University Lab Computer:
- Pro: Anaconda and JupyterLab is already installed.
- Pro: Computers work well, have a big monitor, come with a quiet workspace.
- Con: You need to be in person to use these computers, and they are only available during class, and when lab is not in use. [See 25Live Schedule for MH031](https://25live.collegenet.com/pro/wwu#!/home/search/location/availabilityWeekly/115185)
- Con: Make sure you have your EODA thumb drive to save your work!

##### Advantages & Disadvantages of Personal Computer:
- Pro: You'll take python, JupyterLab and knowlege of your file structure with you after class is over!
- Pro: You can work at any time from any place. 
- Con: You may have a different operating system that's harder to use (i.e. Windows)
- Con: You may have a funky computer that causes you issues (low disk space, irregular file structure, forgot your power charger!)
- Con: You should still always have your EODA thumd drive with you. 

#### After you decide what computer you'll be working on for the quarter: 
Start with either finding a Terminal (you can search for this using *Finder* on a Mac - on the Lab Computers, or a Mac laptop) or by following instructions in the [Installing JupyterLab](Pages/installing_jupyterlab) page to install Anaconda and JupyterLab on your personnal machine (Windows or Mac). 

Once JupyterLab is installed - open a Terminal and type the following to launch JupyterLab (DO NOT TYPE THE $) - 

```
$ jupyter lab
```

This will open a JupyterLab application in your web browser.  Follow instructions and links in the [Intro to JupyterLab](Pages/intro_to_jupyterlab) page to get started!
