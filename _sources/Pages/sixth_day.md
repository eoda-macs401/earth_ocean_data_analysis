# **For the sixth day of class:**

#### Where we're at:

Congraulations we're (past) half way!  Things may start to speed up a bit from here - get ready!  You had last week to spend some time practicing using functions, and also reading about [Python Environments](../Pages/python_environments), [Data](../Notebooks/data), and maybe even [Final Projects](../Pages/projects).  This will be useful as we move forward (rapidly!) into some acutal Data Analysis, and even start solidfying our Final Project plan. 

This week will be all about NumPy and Matplotlib - fundamental packages for data analysis.  

#### Preperation for the future:

For the second half of the course, well switch gears slightly, and you'll be asked to read and reference *this week's* reading assignment in order to complete the homework for *this week* (as opposed to reading ahead)!  This week's assigned reading is focused on [NumPy and Matplotlib](../Pages/numpy_and_matplotlib), and you'll need to read and reference that carefully to complete [Assignment 6](../Assignments/numpy_matplotlib). 

If this was a 4 credit course, we'd spend easily a whole week (two meetings!) or likely more practicing plotting techniques with Matplotlib.  We wont' have that much time this quarter (unfortunately!), but for reference, or if you'd like more practice, an additional page on [More Matplotlib](../Notebooks/more_matplotlib) has also been posted along with an [*Optional* Assignment 6a](../Assignments/more_matplotlib). This will demonstrate how to make your plots look nice, fix axes, add colors, etc.


### For today, in class: 

We'll spend some time discussing `Python Environments` and how to `import Python packages` and make `NumPy Arrays` in class.  We'll get as far through the [NumPy and Matplotlib](../Pages/numpy_and_matplotlib) content as we can - and you'll take it from there wiht you homework!

For your homework, complete [Assignment 6 - NumPy and Matplotlib](../Assignments/numpy_matplotlib).  **EDIT** (IGNORE OLD INSTRUCTIONS: Publish this to a new GitHub repostory called `data_analysis` and make me a collaborator!) New Instructions: Publish this to your `python-projects` github repostory - remember to push any changes (this assignment) to that repo.  If you'd like, also complete [*Optional* Assignment 6a on More Matplotlib](../Assignments/more_matplotlib).

### Homework Summary:


1. Complete [Assignment 6 - NumPy and Matplotlib](../Assignments/numpy_matplotlib). *Optionally* complete [*Optional* Assignment 6a on More Matplotlib](../Assignments/more_matplotlib)
2. Before next week, have read about [NumPy and Matplotlib](../Pages/numpy_and_matplotlib) and optionally [More Matplotlib](../Notebooks/more_matplotlib).
