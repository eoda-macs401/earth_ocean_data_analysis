# First Class - Assignment

### What to do: 
- Make sure JupyterLab is installed correctly on your machine, or that you are accessing a University computer with it installed in MH031.
- Carefully read the page: **Intro to JupyterLab** and follow the links to read about the Markdown syntax (i.e. [Markdown Guide / Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)). 
- Create a new Markdown file using JupyterLab. Call this file "First_Class_Reflection.md". Save it on your eoda thumbdrive in a folder called "Day1"
- Using syntax for headings, lists, etc., that you learned about on the Intro to JupyterLab page (and links embedded), include the following content in your new Markdown file.

#### Include in your Markdown file:
1. How are you planning on working this quarter? What computer do you plan to use? What opporating system is it? 
2. Did you have any issues setting up JupyterLab or accessing it for the first time?

##### *Next, move on to the Unix Tutorial page.*  

When you've completed the Unix Tutorial, add the additional inforamtion to your new Markdown file:

3. How did the Unix Tutorial go?  Do you feel like you are understanding how to access and navigate through your computer's file structure? Are there any commands you practiced that are confusing or did you hit any "roadblocks"?

4. What is one goal you have for the quarter?

## Finishing up

Come to our class on April 11th with your completed Markdown file saved to your thumb drive.  Try to have used the "Show Markdown Preview" functionality within JupyterLab to confirm that your markdown syntax looks good adn makes for a nicely formatted document.  We'll turn these files in next week (when I'm back with you in class).
